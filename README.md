# Battleship challenge
This repository contains a simple go program that creates a 
a set of arrays to manage the backend state of an imaginary battleship game

This was written for a coding challenge in February 2020

While the project is very simplistic its intent is to illustrate some knoweledge of basic data structures
and coding practices in golang.
